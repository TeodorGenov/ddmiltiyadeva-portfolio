								I've always loved taking pictures of people, landscapes and animals because photos are something that stays forever with you, even if the people or animals leave. However as it is said, owning a camera doesn't make you a photographer. I got a camera but all I knew was taking pictures with the automatic mode. Despite achieving okay-is results, I wasn’t satisfied with them only because I couldn’t operate the camera to its full potential.
							</p>
							<p class="mt-3">
								During the minor we had a lecture about Photography with a lecturer who was a photographer themselves. In this lecture we could see many examples and leaned the basics of photography such as ISO, shutter speed and the aperture. Most importantly, it was very well explained how they work together. This inspired my to sign up for a full course of Photography from mid-April to mid-May. This course explained additional things such as the history of photography, creative uses of lightning, lenses, rules for taking a portrait and others. 
							</p>
							<p class="mt-3">As a result, I shot about one thousand photos just for the month of May. Thankfully, the models - my boyfriend Teodor and my hamster, loved being in front of the camera.</p>

								A logo is one of the most important parts of a company’s corporate design as it represents the company’s identity, its values and needs to connect to the company’s target audience. Creating a logo is not an easy job, especially when your client doesn’t know what they want or when you can’t make it exactly as they want.
							</p>
							<p class="mt-3">Because of the power logos have, I am generally frightened by having to carry such a big responsibility - basically holding the company’s future in my own hands. However, after a few sketches and feedback rounds, the projects were happily accepted by the customers.</p>

Having created a logo, what better way to finish up the corporate identity of a company than providing a detailed brand book with logo meaning, usage, typography and so many more. As I am all about organization and perfection, I know that creating corporate identities can save valuable time and prevent many arguments over not using the right brand HEX color code.

							The brand name was chosen to be my own name which makes it more personal and shows the personal touch I add to my designs. The logotype is the brand name - Daniela Miltiyadeva, while the logo mark consists of the two initials of the brand name - D and M. The initials which are used as the logo-mark are illustrated with a bold hand-written font, which is similar to my own handwriting. The logotype is a sans-serif modern font (Montserrat), which complements the bold handwritten font.

						At the beginning of the minor Graphic Design I was put into a group of five girls and we were given the task to create a design studio of our own. Struggling to choose a name together, we sat down and thought of different ideas, we researched, looked for inspiration when we came up with the idea for a studio called “Diverse”, because all of our styles were diverse. While working on the logo for Diverse, I came up with the name 5 in 1, representing the five girls into one team, which still had the meaning of Diverse behind it but also showed that we are somehow united.

						Another logo project which I did for the Minor Graphic Design was a logo for a non-profit Bulgarian organization which protects endangered species and plans to create a botanical garden. The logo had to represent the connection between humans and nature and had to be usable in black and white. Therefore, the logo I created consisted of a human hand as the stem of a tree with leaves to represent the nature.

Buro&Co was a project given to our newly found company 5in1 Design Studio as a part of the minor Graphic Design. The project consisted of creating a logo and brand identity for a communication company, and honestly, it has been one of the hardest projects I’ve had to work on. While struggling to find motivation and sources of inspiration, many different designs were created both by me and my teammates.
					</p>
					<p>
						The final proposal that we came up with consisted of a rather simple typography logo, with a bit of playfulness at the end. The idea behind it was for the O to represent a person (their head and shoulders).
